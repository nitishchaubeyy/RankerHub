## 🌿 Git Workflow & Branching Conventions

To keep the repository history clean, please follow these branching and commit message conventions:

### Branch Naming
Create a new branch from `main` before starting your work:
- `feat/feature-name` – for new features
- `fix/bug-name` – for bug fixes
- `docs/doc-updates` – for documentation changes
- `refactor/refactored-code` – for code restructuring without changing behavior
- `chore/task-name` – for maintenance tasks or package upgrades

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/user-leaderboard
```

### Commit Messages (Semantic Commits)
Write clear and descriptive commit messages following the semantic commit pattern:
- `feat: add female developer ranking page`
- `fix: resolve auth validation issue`
- `docs: update setup steps in README`
- `style: fix button alignment on dashboard`
- `refactor: clean up firebase initialization code`

## 🚀 How to Contribute (GSSoC Rules)

1. **Find an Issue**: Search the [Issues](https://github.com/indresh404/RankerHub/issues) tab for open issues.
2. **Request Assignment**: Comment on the issue stating that you'd like to work on it. Wait for a project maintainer to assign it to you before starting work.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Once your changes are complete, commit and push them to your fork.
   - Go to the original RankerHub repository and click **New Pull Request**.
   - Fill out the PR template completely: explain what changes you made and link the issue it resolves (e.g. `Closes #12`).
   - Ensure there are no merge conflicts and that your build passes.

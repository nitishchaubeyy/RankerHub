   cd RankerHub
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Firebase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Production Build (Firebase Config Error)

If you see errors like `Firebase config error: apiKey is missing` or `FirebaseError: Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key)` in production, this is due to how Vite compiles environment variables.

### The Problem
* The `.env` file containing your keys is excluded from git (`.gitignore`).
* When the project builds on a production deployment server (such as **GitHub Actions** for Firebase Hosting), Vite cannot read the `.env` file, and compiles the bundle with `undefined` values.

### The Solution (For Firebase Hosting via GitHub Actions)
To fix this, you must feed the environment variables to the GitHub Actions build pipeline:

1. **Add Repository Secrets to GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository -> **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.
   - Under **Repository secrets**, click **New repository secret** and add each variable:
     * `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
     * `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
     * `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
     * `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
     * `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
     * `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
     * `VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`

2. **Workflows Update**:
   Our deployment workflows in [.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml](.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml) and [.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml](.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml) are set up to pass these secrets into Vite during the build phase:
   ```yaml
   - run: npm ci && npm run build
     env:
       VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY }}
       VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN: ${{ secrets.VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN }}
       # ... and so on
   ```
